## Examples

Each example in this directory contains three files:

* index.js: The example scenario written w/ JSXAPI

* index_sugar.js: The example scenario written with $ugar + JSXAPI

* interface.xml: A file containing all the "assets" (buttons, widgets, etc) to run an example on a device or sandbox

For more information on running the examples, see "[Running The Examples](../docs/running-the-examples.md)" and each example's README document
