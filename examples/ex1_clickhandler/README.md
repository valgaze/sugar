## Description

Lots of buttons that display text and query the device volume/state + a widget that logs to your macro console 

As you'll see in later examples, you can take user input and do something with it like dispatch to webservices

## Setup

To try on your device, copy & paste ```index_sugar.js``` with the $ugar library (see the [docs](../docs/running-examples.md)
